# Traffic Sign Recognition Program Solution

## Introduction

This my solution to the traffic sign classification project for Term 1 of the
Udacity self-driving car nano-degree program.

## The Project

For reference, the goals / steps of this project were the following:

* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Project Files

My solution consists of the following files and directories:

* [Writeup](writeup.md) is my detailed writeup for the project
* This [IPython notebook](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) contains the code for my solution
* The [web traffic signs](web-traffic-signs) directory contains 5 traffic signs I downloaded from the web to use as an extra test set
* The [web traffic signs processed](web-traffic-signs-processed) directory contains the 5 web traffic signs images cropped and resized

## Dependencies

This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)
